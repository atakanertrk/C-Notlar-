## Dependency Inversion Principle
* High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules (high-level models: depends other modules, low-level modules: not depends anything)
* Main modules should depend abstractions and those abstractions should not depend on details
> Using interfaces and constructors for dependencies in classes, not creating new instances for depending module.
