## WebSocket - WebHook - SignalR(.net)
* server <-> client

## gRPC
#### 1-) general concepts for gRPC
* server <-> server
* gRPC uses binary stream
* 7 times faster than REST when receiving data & roughly 10 times faster than REST when sending data for this specific payload
> gRPC supports streaming semantics, where either the client or the server (or both) send a stream of messages on a single RPC call. The most general case is Bidirectional Streaming where a single gRPC call establishes a stream in which both the client and the server can send a stream of messages to each other.
* protocol buffers ( protobuf ) 
> https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers
* proto file ( standard file for service that describes model state of service )
> details of proto file https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto

## Database Management
* Relational DB ( MySQL SQLServer SQLite->embeded )
> Stored procedures in database
> Roles and Users
> Transactions 
* NoSQL ( MongoDB Litedb->embeded )
